      <title>A Crypto Challenge For The Telegram Developers</title>

	&lt;p&gt;Earlier this week, a company called Telegram announced a &amp;#8220;secure&amp;#8221; mobile messaging product. How secure? In their words of their FAQ, &amp;#8221;&lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; secure.&amp;#8221; Curious to learn more, I went to look at the protocol, and immediately had a number of questions and concerns. However, when pressed on technical details by others, they &lt;a href='https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6916860'&gt;responded&lt;/a&gt; with the academic credentials of their developers (math Ph.Ds) instead of engaging in a more reasonable dialog. They also declined my suggestions for collaboration of any kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most recently, they&amp;#8217;ve chosen to respond to the concerns of the security community with&amp;#8230; a crypto cracking &lt;a href='https://telegram.org/crypto_contest'&gt;contest&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Critique Of Lavabit</title>
      <link>http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/lavabit-critique</link>

	&lt;p&gt;In August of this year, Ladar Levison shut down his email service, Lavabit, in an attempt to avoid complying with a US government request for his users&amp;#8217; emails. To defy the US government&amp;#8217;s gag order and shut down his service took great courage, and I believe that Ladar deserves our support in his legal defense of that decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is now an effort underway to restart the Lavabit project, however, which might be a good opportunity to take a critical look at the service itself. After all, how is it possible that a service which wasn&amp;#8217;t supposed to have access to its users&amp;#8217; emails found itself in a position where it had no other option but to shut down in an attempt to avoid complying with a request for the contents of its users&amp;#8217; emails?&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Suddenly, it feels like 2000 again. Back then, surveillance programs like &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivore_(software%29'&gt;Carnivore&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECHELON'&gt;Echelon&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Information_Awareness'&gt;Total Information Awareness&lt;/a&gt; helped spark a surge in electronic privacy awareness. Now a decade later, the recent discovery of programs like &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PRISM_(surveillance_program%29'&gt;PRISM&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boundless_Informant'&gt;Boundless Informant&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href='http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/interactive/2013/jun/06/verizon-telephone-data-court-order'&gt;FISA orders&lt;/a&gt; are catalyzing renewed concern.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>A Saudi Arabia Telecom's Surveillance Pitch</title>

	&lt;p&gt;Last week I was contacted by an agent of &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobily'&gt;Mobily&lt;/a&gt;, one of two telecoms operating in Saudi Arabia, about a surveillance project that they&amp;#8217;re working on in that country. Having published two reasonably popular &lt;a href='http://www.thoughtcrime.org/software/sslstrip'&gt;MITM tools&lt;/a&gt;, it&amp;#8217;s not uncommon for me to get emails requesting that I help people with their interception projects. I typically don&amp;#8217;t respond, but this one (an email titled &amp;#8220;Solution for monitoring encrypted data on telecom&amp;#8221;) caught my eye.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Guardian's StrongTrustManager Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/strongtrustmanager-mitm</link>

	&lt;p&gt;Last week I saw a tweet about Guardian Project&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;StrongTrustManager,&amp;#8221; which was built for increasing the security of SSL connections in Android. It&amp;#8217;s part of their OnionKit library, and their app Gibberbot uses it to secure its XMPP connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I recently released an &lt;a href='https://github.com/moxie0/AndroidPinning'&gt;Android library&lt;/a&gt; that provides simple SSL pinning support, and have &lt;a href='/blog/authenticity-is-broken-in-ssl-but-your-app-ha'&gt;previously written&lt;/a&gt; about the great opportunity we have for mobile apps to sidestep the &lt;a href='/blog/ssl-and-the-future-of-authenticity'&gt;many problems&lt;/a&gt; plaguing us with CA certificates, so I was excited to see something else out there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I had just released something similar, I went to look at what the Guardian Project implementation provides, and incidentally ended up discovering a few security vulnerabilities. I&amp;#8217;ve decided to write them up here, since they&amp;#8217;ve turned out to be fairly common problems amongst TLS implementations, and might be of some value to document.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Career Advice</title>
      <link>http://www.thoughtcrime.org/blog/career-advice</link>

	&lt;p&gt;To my great surprise, young people now somewhat frequently contact me in order to solicit &lt;em&gt;career advice&lt;/em&gt;. They are usually in college or highschool, and want to know what the best next steps are for a career in security or software development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is, honestly, a really complicated question, mostly because I&amp;#8217;m usually concerned that the question itself might be the wrong one to be asking. What I want to say, more often than not, is something along the lines of &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#8217;t do it&lt;/em&gt;; when I got out of highschool and focused on the answer to that same question, it was very nearly one of the biggest mistakes of my life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I get these inquiries fairly regularly, I thought I&amp;#8217;d write something here that I can use as a sort of canonical starting point for a response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The Worst</title>

	&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t really know who Dustin Curtis is, but he blogs a lot, and those blog entries often end up on Hacker News. Not too long ago, he wrote &lt;a href='http://dcurt.is/the-best'&gt;a blog post titled &amp;#8220;The Best,&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; in which he explains that he has &lt;em&gt;nice stuff&lt;/em&gt;. That in fact, everything he owns is actually the very best of its kind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dustin&amp;#8217;s blog post culminates in the triumph of his quest for the perfect set of flatware. Apparently, this is what the &lt;a href='http://www.momastore.org/museum/moma/ProductDisplay_Yanagi%20Flatware_10451_10001_15622_-1_26669_26672_15623'&gt;perfect collection&lt;/a&gt; of forks, knives, and spoons looks like, which we can assume Dustin Curtis has in his kitchen drawer at this very moment:&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;When it comes to designing secure protocols, I have a principle that goes like this: if you have to perform &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; cryptographic operation before verifying the &lt;a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_authentication_code'&gt;MAC&lt;/a&gt; on a message you&amp;#8217;ve received, it will &lt;em&gt;somehow&lt;/em&gt; inevitably lead to doom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In recent months, Comodo has been &lt;a href='http://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/05/24/comodo_reseller_hacked/'&gt;hacked repeatedly&lt;/a&gt;, DigiNotar was &lt;a href='http://www.darkreading.com/authentication/167901072/security/attacks-breaches/231601790/diginotar-hacked-out-of-business.html'&gt;compromised&lt;/a&gt;, and the security of CAs as a whole has been found to be &lt;a href='http://www.securityweek.com/comodohacker-claims-major-globalsign-breach-company-hires-diginotar-cyber-investigators'&gt;not altogether inspiring&lt;/a&gt;. The consensus finally seems to be shifting from the notion that CAs are merely a ripoff, to the notion that they are a ripoff, a security problem, and that &lt;em&gt;we want them dead as immediately as possible&lt;/em&gt;. The only question that remains is &lt;a href='http://convergence.io'&gt;how to replace them&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;h2 id='basicconstraints_back_then'&gt;BasicConstraints Back Then&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one week it will have been 9 years since I first published sslsniff &amp;#8212; way back in 2002!&amp;#160; While sslsniff has evolved to be a general-purpose MITM tool for SSL connections, I originally published it as a proof of concept exploit for the BasicConstraints vulnerability that I &lt;a href='http://www.thoughtcrime.org/ie-ssl-chain.txt'&gt;released&lt;/a&gt; along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>SSL And The Future Of Authenticity</title>

	&lt;h2 id='the_background'&gt;The Background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the early 90&amp;#8217;s, at the dawn of the World Wide Web, some engineers at Netscape developed a protocol for making secure HTTP requests, and what they came up with was called SSL. Given the relatively scarce body of knowledge concerning secure protocols at the time, as well &lt;a href='http://www.jwz.org/gruntle/nscpdorm.html'&gt;the intense pressure everyone at Netscape was working under&lt;/a&gt;, their efforts can only be seen as incredibly heroic. It&amp;#8217;s amazing that SSL has endured for as long as it has, in contrast to a number of other protocols from the same vintage. We&amp;#8217;ve definitely learned a lot since then, though, but the thing about protocols and APIs is that there&amp;#8217;s very little going back.&lt;/p&gt;
